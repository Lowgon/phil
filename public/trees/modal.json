      "question": "Some people hesitate when asked whether things could have been different. This hesitation usually reflects one of two worries: they might feel that possibility is just a feature of how we think — a product of our minds — or they might feel that possibility doesn’t really exist in the world at all.",

    "Q2": {
      "question": "When you say things could have been different, what do you imagine makes that possible? Is it that logic allows it, that our concepts allow it, that such alternatives could really exist out there, that the laws of nature permit them, or simply that you don’t know enough to rule them out?",
